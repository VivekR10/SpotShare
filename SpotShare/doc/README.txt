SpotShare
Brooks Klinker, Joann Lin, Robert Diersing, Drew Perlman, and Vivek Ramachandran 

Notes:
A prepopulated SQL database file, called Dump20170414.sql, is located in the SpotShare folder.
To test out the multithreading, open up two instances of SpotShare and log in as two different users (one user
must be following the other). Then, as the user who is being followed, save a pin to the map. The pin should
show up live and the feed should then be updated for the user who is following the user who just saved the pin.
